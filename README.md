### GUCera-Website

This is our first web development project along with database management. In this project, we focused on the backend more than the frontend as our main goal was practising designing and querying an SQL Server database. 

We used SQL Server, C#, html and CSS.

in order to run our code
download it
create a new database and run the database definition 
in the web config change the connection string to the connection string of your databse 
run the login.aspx
